# A short history of the internet for networking students

### Preface

 A student studying an immense topic like the internet may find themselves having difficulty finding where to begin. Reviewing history is a natural place to start, and relating that to the present can bring the new perspective to the modern technologies we take advantage of today. With this in mind, I will discuss what I have found about the start of the internet and how it has evolved from an experimental governmental research project, to the defining medium of the 21st century. A progression of blog posts will detail the history, and in parallel, discus the construction and implementation of a private home network. I will proceed through connecting to an ISP, setting up a private access point, and ultimately running several networking central technologies such as:
	- hardware [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com/) Router and Synology Wi-Fi
- software defined routing via Intel NIC card + old pc + [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/)  
- pfSense addons [pfBlocker](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/packages/pfblocker.html) (firewall), [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) (VPN), [Suricata]( https://suricata.io/features/) (IDS/IPS)
- [ProxMox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) (Hypervisor) with Windows Server 2019 & [Security Onion](https://securityonionsolutions.com/software/)

hopefully reflecting along the way with lessons learned, to frame the process as an educational exercise.

## What is having the internet?

If you want to listen to the transmission of sound there needs to be air, to carry the sound energy, and an ear or otherwise device to “hear” the noise. No doubt inspired by this natural system, humans copied this method, abstracting it to the telephone wire via the telegraph (Alexander Graham Bell 1874) and then using the air via electromagnetic waves (Guglielmo Marconi 1895).  

Whether through air or wire, we need a medium to send signals and a corresponding receiver to catch and decode them. With a radio, the signal receiver is attached to a speaker translate that signal back into sound, although it can now be wholly saved digitally for playback later. For television, we do much the same, somehow receiving a compound signal of audio and video information through radio waves or wire--often coaxial copper cabling. To help disperse these signals, a network of sorts was created for television. An early implementation of this was Community Antenna Television (CATV), which consisted of a community antenna that would receive a broadcast signal and then rebroadcast it locally, just like today's network affiliates. Phones similarly rely on a networking of cables that enable their messages to be distributed and rebroadcast, as they travel to their destinations. Seen in context with these technologies, the internet can be seen as a natural progression of these early information exchange networks. And just as cable TV utilized existing phone infrastructure, the internet utilizes both previous infrastructures today: [coaxial cable](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coaxial_cable) and two wire [phone line](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Telephone_cable).

All of the above technologies were and are technologies whose central role was to distribute any data that could be recorded. This process is akin to quantification: In mathematics and empirical science, quantification (or quantitation) is the act of counting and measuring that maps human sense observations and experiences into quantities [^1]. This quantification process has enabled us to collect and share data as never before. 

For affect, just think how constrained one was to place and time, as say, if you wanted to attend a play. You would need a ticket to reserve a physical space at a specific, unique time for you to experience the production as it occurs on stage. With quantification (i.e. video recording), that experience can mostly be recorded and recreated on demanding, freeing it from the strictures of time and place. This sounds like a fairly powerful thing. So, how does one "internet?" Well, let's just say it is exceedingly more complicated than the former technologies.

## Getting on the map, an 'internet address'

What can we do to buy a ticket to the internet? One might start with an "access point" that is a unique 32-bit binary IPv4 or 128-bit hexadecimal Ipv6 address leased to you by an internet service provider (ISP). This will act as your name on the network, and you will use it as a home address so that you can send and receive messages from its “location” as a node belonging to the network. The rules and system that regulates the dispensation of the addresses is regulated by the IETF and is called the Domain Name System. Your ISP will be allowed use of a range of addresses and there customers are leased an address. Ultimately, a network interface card (NIC) or access point router will take on this address to be used by your systems on the public internet. There is a distinction that you can use whatever addresses you wish in your private network, but on the public interent, you must have a unique IP. Being a core item to being on the network, this IP address can be found on the L3 "network layer." 

Layer one of what? Well, the internet is often summarized abstractly as a discretely separated, but interworking, layered model. As you will see, the layers pass data to one another by packaging in with headers and footers. Regarding the addressing system, a user actually will have two addresses, one physical for [layer one (L1)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OSI_model#/Layer_architecture) and the other abstracted according to the domain name system that was implemented for internet protocol (IPv4 or IPv6). The IP address exists above layer one on layer two (the data link layer) and is a necessary component to operate as host node on the network.

## Early implementations of packet-switching protocols

The above mentioned IP address is part of the [Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP Model](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_protocol_suite) (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol), the core component of the modern internet. It was initially developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([DARPA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DARPA)) in the late 1960s, and is still now the utilized protocol. In your studies, you will find that these protocols are responsible for ordering, verifying and transmitting data. But before that discussion, let us review how the TCP/IP standard came to fruition.

Today, the technical standards underlying the internet protocol suite are maintained by a division of the United Nations: the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF).


In addition to being familiar with this, one should know of the [OSI model](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OSI_model), a conceptual model: a comprehensive design document for building networking systems. Reading internet history, you will find that many models have helped direct the internet’s evolution by giving structure to the myriad of different protocols and packet switching technologies that were devised in the 1970s and 80s. This period of history is known as the [protocol wars]. (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Protocol_Wars)

To get a sense of the net’s lineage one can look to the [The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Telecommunication_Union) another specialized United Nations agency for information and communication technologies that is the predecessor of the IETF. It was founded in 1865 by [Napoleon III](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Napoleon_III) to direct the standardization of the telegraph. They have since published over 4000 recommendations. One of their contributions related to the internet is the European based standard [X.25](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/X.25):

> (being published in 1976) ...it is one of the oldest packet-switching communication protocols available; it was developed several years before IPv4 (1981) and the OSI Reference Model (1984). The protocol suite is designed as three conceptual layers, which correspond closely to the lower three layers of the seven-layer OSI model. It also supports functionality not found in the OSI network layer.

That being said, for practical purposes, it's sufficient today to just understand the OSI model and the TCP/IP protocol, as well as the many improvements that have been added by IETF and vendors. The internet’s history is messy, a side effect of its collaborative, iterative nature that has its roots in the academic and institutional R&D domains.

## OSI and TCP/IP to send PDUs

As a networking engineer, you should become familiar with the OSI model. Several have been formulated but for this blog, I will exclusively reference the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) 7-layer model that was published in 1984. Starting with layer 1 it goes: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

![osi](/static/images/osi.webp)
<p>
Each layer groups a number of technologies that perform various functions in the network.  
</p>

Referencing the above model, your public IP address (AKA IP) exists on layer 3, the Network layer. Your IP will be utilized to identify yourself and other computers in network. In essence, you are purchasing access to the internet through an ISP that acts as a courier service to send and receive data for you through the internetworked mesh that is the ‘internet.’ Further discussion on ISP particulars is not pertinent at this moment, suffice to say that telecommunications companies run high-capacity cables to coordinate web traffic between hosts and servers, utilizing a specialized L3 routing protocol called [Border Gateway Protocol](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Border_Gateway_Protocol) (BGP). A tertiary concept you may have heard about is “[edge computing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Edge_computing#).” Per Wikipedia, “The origins of edge computing lie in [content distributed networks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Content_delivery_network) that were created in the late 1990s to serve web and video content from edge [servers](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Server_(computing)>) that are deployed closer to users for quick access.

Returning to our public IPv4 address, we may realize that one address is not enough for the many devices and users that exists in our household. Remember, public IPs must be unique. Thus, our address must be shared somehow, to allow for multiple users to still utilize one address while keeping their traffic separate. A hardware device called a router can be introduced to solve this problem through a process called Port Address Translation (PAT).

As an aside, in networking there are often multiple types of the same thing. I think of this as a reminder of the duplicative nature of the system. For instance, data has many names or forms based on its context and position in the system. Each layer of the model has its own protocol data unit (PDU): L1 Bits; L2 Frames; L3 Packets; L4 Segments. As you learn about how the network functions, you will understand how the data continually modified, packaged and re-packaged to coordinate its travel along the network path.

The two most central forms of this re-packaging occur at two different localities of the internet, L2 and L3. For L2, remember Data-link is always network local using MAC addressing. If data needs to leave the local network, it will need an IP address to operate on L3. L2 is much simpler, and operates with a few additional technologies to enable a frames movement from within a local network. Unlike IP addresses, which do not change at each hop, L2 frames have their source and destination address replaced to direct their movement at each router (AKA frame rewrite. Switches do not perform frame rewrites; they exclusively pass frames along per their Content Addressable Memory (CAM) and tagged VLAN information.

For out of LAN traffic (AKA inter-network traffic), L3 [Network Layer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Network_layer) implements routing algorithms that act as a ‘traffic cop protocol,’ directing packets in the most efficient manner possible. An important point to be made is that packets are not self-determining, ie, they merely contain their data payload inside L3 with additional meta-data in the header/footer that is utilized by whichever L3 technology it encounters. Packets can pass through various protocols before reaching their destination. 

To summarize, the TCP/IP protocol is only one of many L3 “Network” protocols that go about executing OSI’s dictum: the relaying of [packets](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Packet_(information_technology)>) from one [network segment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Network_segment) to another by [nodes](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Node_(networking)>) in a [computer network](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computer_network) via [packet forwarding](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Packet_forwarding). Including [routing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Routing) packets through intermediate [routers.](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Router_(computing)>). A network trace route command can be used to readback information concerning the packet's travel, e.g., how many “hops” (trips between routers) a packet has made.

These “Network” protocols are algorithmic logic that are usually run-on ASIC hardware embedded, although software implementations exist. For example, three routing protocols are supported by the networking BSD OS [pfSense]( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PfSense). In the next post, we will plan and set up a home network utilizing a pfSense computer and a router.
