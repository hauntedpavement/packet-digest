# Setting up a private home network: VLAN & Subnetworking, a student’s perspective

### Preface

 A student studying an immense topic such as the internet is, may find themselves having difficulty finding where to begin their investigation. Reviewing history is a natural place to start, and relating that to the present can bring the new perspective to the modern technologies we take advantage of today. With this in mind, I will discuss what I have found about the start of the internet and how it has evolved from an experimental governmental research project, to the defining medium of the 21st century. A progression of blog posts will detail the history, and in parallel, discus the construction and implementation of an “homelab” which includes implementing a private home network. I will proceed to work through the steps, reflecting along the way to frame the the process as an educational exercise.

## What is having the internet?

If you want to listen to the transmission of sound, we need a radio an object with an antenna to catch electromagnetic signals, with a corresponding audio receiver attached to translate that signal back into sound, through a speaker. For television, we do much the same, somehow receiving a compound signal of audio and video information through radio waves or copper cabling. The earliest implementation of this was Community Antenna Television (CATV), which consisted of a community antenna that would receive the broadcast signal and then rebroadcast it locally (just like today's network affiliates). Phones similarly rely on a networking of cables that enable their messages to be distributed and rebroadcast, as they travel to their destination. Just as cable TV utilized existing phone infrastructure, the internet utlizes both previous infrastructures today: [coaxial cable](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coaxial_cable) and two wire [phone line](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Telephone_cable).

All of the above technologies were and are technologies whose central role was to distribute any data that could be recorded. This process is akin to quantification: In mathematics and empirical science, quantification (or quantitation) is the act of counting and measuring that maps human sense observations and experiences into quantities. This quantification process has enabled us to collect and share data as never before. 

For effect, just think how constrained one was to place and time, as say, if you wanted to attend a play, you would need a ticket to reserve a physical space in that specific, unique time for you to experience the production as it occurs on stage. With technology, that experience has been recreated and freed from the strictures of time and place. This sounds like a fairly powerful thing. So, how does one "internet?" Well, let's just say it is exceedingly more complicated than the former technologies.

## Getting out 'internet address'

What can we do to buy a ticket to the internet? One might start with an "access point" that is a unique 32-bit IPv4 address, of the public variety, leased to you by an internet service provider (ISP). This will act as your name on the network, and you will use it as a home address so that you can send and receive messages from your “location.” Being a core item, this address is found on layer one (the internet can be understood abstractly as a discretely separated, but interworking, layered model. The model is interworking in many ways, regarding our address, a user actually will have two addresses, one physical for [layer one (L1)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OSI_model#/Layer_architecture) and then an internet protocol (IPv4 or 6) that exists on layer two (data link layer) and is a necessary component to operate as host node on the network.

The above mentioned is part of the [Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP Model](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_protocol_suite) (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol), the core component of the modern internet. It was initially developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([DARPA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DARPA)) in the late 1960s, and is still now the utilized protocol. In your studies, you will find that these protocols are responsible for identifying, sending and receiving packets. But before that, let us discuss how this modern internet standard came to fruition.

Today, the technical standards underlying the internet protocol suite are maintained by a division of the United Nations: the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF). In addition to being familiar with this, one should know of the [OSI model](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OSI_model), a "reccomendation standard" that is a comprehensive design document for buiilding networking systems in general. Reading internet history, you will find that models helped evolve the interenet by giving structure to the myraid of different protocols and packet switching implementations that were devised, at great pace, in the early internet experienced in the 1970s and 80s. This history is known as the "protocol wars."

To give a sense of the lineage of the interent one can look to the [The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Telecommunication_Union) a specialized United Nations agency for information and communication technologies. It was founded in 1865 by [Napoleon III](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Napoleon_III) to direct the standardization of the telegraph. They have since published over 4000 recommendations. Their contribution related to the internet is [X.25](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/X.25):

> (being published in 1976) ...it is one of the oldest packet-switching communication protocols available; it was developed several years before IPv4 (1981) and the OSI Reference Model (1984). The protocol suite is designed as < three conceptual layers, which correspond closely to the lower three layers of the seven-layer OSI model. It also supports functionality not found in the OSI network layer.

Today, it's sufficient to understand the OSI model and the TCP/IP protocol. 

Referencing the above model, your public IP address exists in layer 3, the Network layer. In practice, the modern internet utilizes TCP/IP’s internet layer. Your IP will be utilized to identify yourself and other computers in network. you are purchasing access to the internet through an ISP as a service to send and receive data through the internetworked mesh that is the ‘internet’ further discussion is not pertinent, suffice to know that telecommunications companies run fiber optic cable to coordinated web traffic to host/server, utilizing a specialized L3 protocol BGP. A tertiary concept you may have heard about is “[edge computing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Edge_computing#).” Per Wikipedia, “The origins of edge computing lie in [content distributed networks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Content_delivery_network) that were created in the late 1990s to serve web and video content from edge [servers](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Server_(computing)>) that were deployed close to users.

Returning to our public IPv4 address, we may realize that one address is not enough for the many devices and users that exists in our household. That would be correct, thus our address must be shared somehow. A router will be introduced to solves this problem, and some others. As an aside, in networking there are often multiple types of the same thing. I think of this as a reminder of the iterative nature of the system. Something that has many meanings based on context is ‘address.’ I think this is because of the linked nature of the internet, where the system is divided in two, so that there are a link of addresses, with a packet jumping to the next point, and verifying itself, again and again, along the way.

Indeed a packet does somewhat work this way, by coming apart to verify it’s address, and then replace it’s address with new one’s: a new ‘source address’ and a new ‘destination address’ that was given to it by a ‘traffic cop protocol’ that is running on L3, the [Network Layer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Network_layer) of OSI’s model. The TCIP/IP protocol mentioned earlier, is only one of many L3 “Network” protocols that go about executing OSI’s dictum: the relaying of [packets](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Packet_(information_technology)>) from one [network segment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Network_segment) to another by [nodes](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Node_(networking)>) in a [computer network](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computer_network) via [packet forwarding](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Packet_forwarding). Including [routing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Routing) packets through intermediate [routers.](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Router_(computing)>). A network trace route command can be used to readback information concerning the packet's travel, eg, how many “hops” (trips between routers) a packet has made.

These “Network” protocols are algorithmic logic that are run as emedded into ios firmware utilizing hardware, or can be more software implemented on computer hardware. For example, three routing protocols are supported by the networking BSD OS pfSense.
